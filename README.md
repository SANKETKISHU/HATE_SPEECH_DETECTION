**Hate Speech Detection with CNN**

This Python script detects hate speech in text data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It preprocesses the dataset, builds the model architecture, and provides an interactive interface for users to input text or speech. The model is trained on balanced data and achieves accuracy metrics, visualized through plots. It leverages TensorFlow, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries for efficient implementation.

**Key Features:**
- Dataset preprocessing
- CNN model architecture
- Interactive text or speech input interface
- Training and validation accuracy/loss visualization

**Dependencies:**
- TensorFlow
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- speech_recognition

**Usage:**
- Run the script to interact with the hate speech detection system.
- Enter text manually or speak to input text.
- View the model's predictions and probability distributions.

**Dataset:**
- The dataset used for training and testing is stored in the `hate_speech.csv` file.

**Model Training:**
- The script trains the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks.

**Evaluation:**
- The model's accuracy and loss metrics are visualized through plots to assess training and validation performance.
